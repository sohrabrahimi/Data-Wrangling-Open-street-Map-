# Description
In this project I chose Pittsburgh, PA from [https://www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=10/42.4108/-71.1131) and used data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that I cared about the most i.e. Pittsburgh. This project has been conducted via SQL API in Python. This project covers the following topics: 

* Python
* SQL
* Data Wrangling
* Unstructured data format (JSON, HTML, XML)
